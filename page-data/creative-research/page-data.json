Talking with people about the ways they make art has triggered me to be more reflective about my own process.</p>\n<p>This is me writing down some thoughts about my artistic process in order to better understand it, and hopefully to prompt others to reflect on their own patterns of making or learning.</p>\n<!--\nI make a lot of artwork and small projects. My creative process is something that I developed organically, but over time I've met other creators and learned from their practice, I've put more time into the way that I go about things, and thought it would be worthwhile to put somet thoughts into writing. -->\n<h3>Why do I make art?</h3>\n<p>Creating things is a way to have a conversation with the world.</p>\n<p>I might have a passing thought or observation: “These birds move in a nice way.”</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.hswstatic.com/gif/murmuration.jpg\" alt=\"starling murmuration\"></p>\n<p>but re-forming that idea with my own hands means engaging with it from different angles.</p>\n<p>Making art builds my understanding of the world and of my own perception. It gives me a structure to think ideas through and teaches me new ways to appreciate the world.</p>\n<p>Giving shape to an idea also helps me to communicate it. Sharing something with others and hearing their perspective is another layer of learning.</p>\n<h2>Why do I make art with computers?</h2>\n<p>I wish I knew! If you’ve programmed a computer, you probably know that it’s not an inately pleasurable experience. Computers would prefer not to make artwork, and they’re very efficient at finding ways to avoid doing what you want.</p>\n<p>Convincing the computer to make art forces me to enter a very focused state, like threading a series of needles while rotating an idea in my head.</p>\n<p>Left alone, my mind spends its energy worrying about things I can’t control or generally bouncing around and knocking into things. Writing code is a good activity for me because I can tire my mind out on less destructive activities, like naming variables.</p>\n<!-- Another aspect of using computers to make art is the feeling of control. I think that working with a material that gives me precise control over its final shape feels pleasurable and safe to me in a way that music, paint, clay, or wood don't. But that may be reflective of my skills more than it is reflective of  -->\n<h2>Coding as understanding</h2>\n<p>I think that all forms of art teach you new ways to pay attention to your surroundings, but for me programming is</p>\n<h2>Art as research</h2>\n<h2>Creative &#x26; emotional cyles:</h2>\n<p>Because of the fiddly and frictive nature of using computers, and because of my own moodiness, I’ve found that creativity is something that comes in phases for me.</p>\n<p>I handle different tasks when I have different types of energy to spare.</p>\n<h2>points of departure</h2>\n<p>Starting new things based on sparks or ideas!</p>\n<ul>\n<li>natural beauty</li>\n<li>ideas that I find beautiful</li>\n<li>recreating an artwork</li>\n<li>learning new technologies</li>\n<li>forking other people’s demos</li>\n</ul>\n<p>-> happens when i’m in nature, or talking with people, or whenever.</p>\n<p>-> I usually can’t immediately start working on these, so i write them down for later, or do inital research on the web to learn more and build a list of resources.</p>\n<h3>yak shaving, setup, schleping</h3>\n<p>Setting up new tools and building out programming environments for myself can be really hard work.</p>\n<p>Installing dependencies and writing the first layers of code that set</p>\n<h3>building out core abstractions</h3>\n<p>requires optimism, math, different aproaches, design thinking</p>\n<h3>exploration, recombinate creativity</h3>\n<p>parameter space exploration\nhook up midi control</p>\n<h3>ergonomic investments, oss contributions</h3>\n<p>waiting for inspiration,</p>\n<h3>outward energy, documentation</h3>\n<h3>Not wanting to make things</h3>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Creative Research Process","date":"January 07, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/creative-research/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/SFPC-meet-the-students/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"SFPC \"Meet the Students\""}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/post1/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Thinking about Color (WIP)"}}}}}
