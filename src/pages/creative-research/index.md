### Or, what am I doing when I'm making art? (WIP DONT READ)

I like making art with computers, but it can feel strange sometimes. Art and computing are two fields that come wrapped up with a lot of ideas about what is the proper way to go about them. When mixed, their respective preconceptions can come into tension. Existing at this intersection requires reconsidering things you've learned about the correct way to develop software, or the right way to make art.

This is a road I've mostly traveled on my own (most computer-based hobbies involve spending a lot of time at home). Recently, especially after attending SFPC, being able to be around more artists and seeing how very differently each person practices their craft has prompted me to be more reflective about my own process.

So, this blog post is me writing down some thoughts about my creative process in order to better understand it, and hopefully to prompt others to reflect on their own patterns of making or learning.
<small> Everything I say is contextualized to what is true for _me_, and some of it is only half true! So please be patient if you experience these things differently. </small>

### Why do I make art?

Creating things is a way to have a conversation with the world.

I might have a passing thought or observation, like: "I enjoy the pattern on this fabric" or "These birds move in a beautiful way."

Holding that idea and re-forming it my own hands means engaging with the idea for a longer time and from different angles.

Making art builds my understanding of the world and of my own perception. It gives me a space and structure to think through ideas and teaches me new ways to appreciate the world.

If art is giving shape to an idea, working towards that shape also helps me to communicate it. Sharing something with others and hearing their perspectives on it is yet another layer of learning and understanding the original idea, or generating new ones.

## Why do I make art with computers?

I wish I knew! If you've programmed a computer, you probably know that it's not an inately pleasurable experience. Computers seem to prefer not to make artwork, or at least they're extremely efficient at finding ways to avoid doing it how you intended them to.

Convincing the computer to make art forces me to hold a focused state, like threading a series of needles while holding an idea in my head. Left alone, my mind spends its energy worrying about things I can't control or generally bouncing around like shoes in a washing machine. Writing code is a good activity for me because I can tire my mind out on less destructive activities, such as naming variables.

More positively, it's very gratifying to express an idea to a computer. Always,after the work of setting the pieces in place inside the computer and letting them play out, it responds to me with an exciting mixture of failures, surprises, gratification, and new ideas.

> "I always seem to be in the process of learning about line and land forms. I learn from what I see and what I draw. What my hand-eye draws is different from what the computer draws. **A computer helps by offering new visual ideas.** These ideas in turn enrich new hand work which generates additional ideas which extends my thinking about computer generated lines."

<!-- Another aspect of using computers to make art is the feeling of control. I think that working with a material that gives me precise control over its final shape feels pleasurable and safe to me in a way that music, paint, clay, or wood don't. But that may be reflective of my skills more than it is reflective of  -->

## Coding as understanding

Like other forms of art, programming teaches you new ways to pay attention to your surroundings.

Writing programs can be seen as the process of translating an idea into a new language. That translation process raises questions and pulls your focus across different aspects of your subject.

If you want to animate a digital inch worm, you're forced to to observe their motions carefully, breaking it into smaller components and understanding how those fit together.

<br>

This process of close observation, modeling, and first-hand experimentation means building intuitions for the system that can be deeper than what I gain through reading other people's findings, or through observation alone. Shaping an idea in your own hands and touching it from many angles results in a multi-faceted understanding. It's my experiece that when I've understood an idea in this way, it's more readily availble to the creative part of my brain in the future, when I'm forming new connections or acting on hunches.

## Art as research

I make artwork in order to learn

## Creative & emotional cyles:

Because of the fiddly and frictive nature of using computers, and because of my own moodiness, I've found that creativity is something that comes in phases for me.

I tackle different tasks when I have different types of energy to spare. These complimentary types of work ideally come together to power my creative research.

## points of departure

Starting new things based on sparks or ideas!

- natural beauty
- ideas that I find beautiful
- recreating an artwork
- learning new technologies
- forking other people's demos

-> happens when i'm in nature, or talking with people, or whenever.

-> I usually can't immediately start working on these, so i write them down for later, or do inital research on the web to learn more and build a list of resources.

### yak shaving, setup, schleping

Setting up new tools and debugging programming environments for myself can be really hard work. The nature of this difficulty is more emotional than technical.

There is very little positive emotional payoff from environment setup work, and having the motivation to tackle it after dealing with my day job or instead of enjoying other activities mean that small things can become serious hurdles.

That being said, this preparation is crucial to having a condusive area to do creative work, and getting it out of the way lowers the activation energy you need in the future to quickly explore ideas!

One way around this is pre-built environments that require little setup. A few examples: - Create React App - glitch.com - shadertoy - editor.p5js.org

I also love to maintain boiler-plate repos that I can clone and go. I'm done this for

do it in advance, prep your area, lower activation energy for the future.

Installing dependencies and writing the first layers of code that set me up

### building out core abstractions

requires optimism, math, different aproaches, design thinking,

Building a world to play in.

### Exploration & Recombinate Creativity

Often, there will be a point in a project where I'm comfortable with a basic foundation, but the result isn't clicking in the way I'd hoped it would. My reaction when I get to this sort of dead end is often to throw things at the wall and see what sticks!

In other words, I'll enter a combinatoric approach to creativity where I'm throwing different effects and concepts from my toolbox into the mix, and seeing if anything interesting presents itself.

The first step is just exploring the parameter space that already exists inside your system. Defining shared numbers like "each octopus has 8 arms" is a natural part of building an idea with code.

The natural next step is asking, how does it look if I change that number to 18? 800? 1? ... -4? This is always a good source of glitches, suprises and ideas.

Exploring a parameter space is it's own skill, and because it's important I put care into making it fun and expressive for myself. This can mean anything from making sure my code is well-organized, to using controller libraries like 'dat.GUI', to even attaching the knobs of a physical midi controller to different values in my program.

(I love how this video shows peeks of the messy edges of a parameter space. Often, there is only a narrow region where a system is "well behaved". Just beyond those boundaries, unparseable or "degenerate" output lurks. Appreciate these spaces as a mystery and a source of beauty!)

Then, I might:

- add some noise.
- not clear my buffer.
- put everything in a grid or along a circle.
- make it rainbow.
- dither the colors.
- wrap it around typography.
- make it react to audio, video, or touch.

These are just a few of my personal favorites, but they're all effects that I'm very comfortable with. Throwing them onto a project without too much thought or energy can be really fun when I'm not feeling .

This form of creativity is something that I used to feel self-concious about, because I thought that I wasn't doing real art if I was just aimlessly smooshing ideas togther. Now, I embrace this as time to partially turn my brain off, and let possibilities present themselves.

It doesn't mean you should never think about why you're doing something, but letting go of that urge can be a good way to keep things flowing :).

### ergonomic investments, oss contributions

waiting for inspiration, reflecting on comfort, sharpening tools,

### outward energy, documentation

Documenting and sharing your work is really important!
Endorphin payoff (or crash!)

There are some emotional pitfalls.

### Not wanting to make things

This is part of the cycle too! It's natural to have ebbs and flow in your excitement. Feeling guilty for this is harmful. I try to remember that creative output is a life-long journey, and that "performance" is a state of balance between forces in my life.
