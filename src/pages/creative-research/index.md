### Or, what am I doing when I'm making art? (WIP DONT READ)

<iframe src="https://maxbittker.github.io/chromatophore/"></iframe>

I like making art with computers, but it can feel strange sometimes. Art and computing are two fields that come wrapped up with a lot of ideas about what is the proper way to go about them.

When art and technology are mixed, their respective preconceptions can come into tension and cease to be useful. Existing at this intersection requires reconsidering things you've learned about the correct way to develop software, or the right way to make art.

This is a road I've mostly traveled on my own (most computer-based hobbies involve spending a lot of time at home). Recently, especially after attending SFPC, being able to be around more artists and seeing how very differently each person practices their craft has prompted me to be more reflective about my own process.

So, this blog post is me writing down some thoughts about my creative process in order to better understand it, and hopefully to prompt others to reflect on their own patterns of making or learning.

### Why do I make art?

Creating things is a way to have a conversation with the world.

I might have a passing thought or observation, like: "I enjoy the pattern on this fabric" or "These birds move in a beautiful way."

Holding that idea and re-forming it my own hands means engaging with the idea for a longer time and from different angles.

Making art builds my understanding of the world and of my own perception. It gives me a space and structure to think through ideas and teaches me new ways to appreciate the world.

If art is giving shape to an idea, working towards that shape also helps me to communicate it. Sharing something with others and hearing their perspectives on it is yet another layer of learning and understanding the original idea, or generating new ones.

## Why do I make art with computers?

I wish I knew! If you've programmed a computer, you probably know that it's not an inately pleasurable experience. Computers seem to prefer not to make artwork, or at least they're extremely efficient at finding ways to avoid doing it in the way you wanted them to.

Convincing the computer to make art forces me to hold a focused state, like threading a series of needles while holding an idea in my head. Left alone, my mind spends its energy worrying about things I can't control or generally bouncing around like shoes in a washing machine. Writing code is a good activity for me because I can tire my mind out on less destructive activities, such as naming variables.

More positively, it's very gratifying to express an idea to a computer. Always,after the work of setting the pieces in place inside the computer and letting them play out, it responds to me with an exciting mixture of failures, surprises, gratification, and new ideas.

> "I always seem to be in the process of learning about line and land forms. I learn from what I see and what I draw. What my hand-eye draws is different from what the computer draws. **A computer helps by offering new visual ideas.** These ideas in turn enrich new hand work which generates additional ideas which extends my thinking about computer generated lines."

<!-- Another aspect of using computers to make art is the feeling of control. I think that working with a material that gives me precise control over its final shape feels pleasurable and safe to me in a way that music, paint, clay, or wood don't. But that may be reflective of my skills more than it is reflective of  -->

## Coding as understanding

I think that all forms of art teach you new ways to pay attention to your surroundings, but for me programming is

## Art as research

## Creative & emotional cyles:

Because of the fiddly and frictive nature of using computers, and because of my own moodiness, I've found that creativity is something that comes in phases for me.

I handle different tasks when I have different types of energy to spare.

## points of departure

Starting new things based on sparks or ideas!

- natural beauty
- ideas that I find beautiful
- recreating an artwork
- learning new technologies
- forking other people's demos

-> happens when i'm in nature, or talking with people, or whenever.

-> I usually can't immediately start working on these, so i write them down for later, or do inital research on the web to learn more and build a list of resources.
